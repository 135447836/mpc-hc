1.6.7 - not released yet
========================
+ Ticket #2987, Playlist improvements:
  - Scroll and select the first newly added item
  - Put MPC-HC on top and give the focus to the playlist after a drag and drop
* Updated Catalan, Czech, German and Greek translations
* Updated Little CMS to v2.5 (git b58cb85)
* Ticket #2689,  Replace "On top > Never" by "On top > Default". In most of the
  cases "On top > Default" will have the exact same behavior than "On top > Never"
  but it won't try to override the "on top" flag if an external tool sets it
! Fix a crash when VMR-7 (renderless) renderer failed to load
! SSA subtitles rendering: Improve error checking to avoid possible crashes when
  the SSA script was using obviously wrong values
! Ticket #2991, Fix loading of MicroDVD subtitles
! Ticket #3001, "After Playback": Always give "Once" events a higher priority
  than "Always" events
