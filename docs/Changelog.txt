1.7.0 - not released yet
========================
+ Replace the internal filters with LAV Filters.
  LAV Filters are modern open source DirectShow filters based on FFmpeg. They are known to be
  reliable and fast and overall should be more stable than the old filters.
  MPC-HC integrates LAV Filters directly and no extra installation steps are required. The embedded
  version of LAV Filters doesn't interfere at all with other installed DirectShow filters (including
  standalone versions of LAV Filters).
  Note to XP users: hardware decoding is only supported on nVidia graphic adapters. If you
  really need a DXVA decoder, you can use a standalone version of MPC Video Decoder.
+ Support loading HTTP/RTSP/UDP/RTP streams using embedded source filters
+ D3DFullscreen can now switch to windowed mode (just like regular fullscreen mode)
+ Audio Switcher: Show all audio tracks available, including all the embedded tracks exhibited by the
  source filter and the external tracks.
+ Playlist: Add a "Move to Recycle Bin" right click option, with optional keyboard shortcut
+ Ticket #533, Add a command line switch (/device) to open the default video device
+ Ticket #3107, Add support for playing from standard input.
  Use "-" as a special filename to designate the standard input.
  Examples:
    > mpc-hc.exe - < sample.ts
    > a_prog.exe | mpc-hc.exe -
* D3DFullscreen changes:
  - toggle hotkey is now disabled by default
  - support for madVR has been removed (it already has exclusive mode)
  - 10-bit RBG output now falls back to 8-bit output if the display does not support it
* Remove D2VSource. It's unmaintained and basically unused.
* WebUI: Switched to HTML5 and improved the cross browser support
  (IE8 or newer is needed, other browsers should work fine)

! Ticket #2109, #2975, Fix the handling of aspect ratio changes when using EVR-CP or Sync Renderer
  with DXVA decoding

  was previously saved, it will be restored unless the file is already playing.
