===============================
+ Accept loading more than one subtitle file at a time using the "Load subtitle" dialog or drag-and-drop
+ Add advanced settings page

      It should also work much better when the number of subpictures becomes important
    - Subtitle animation can now be disabled even when using no buffering
    - Add the ability to choose at which state (in percentage of the full animation) an animated subtitle
      will be rendered when the animation is turned off

      subtitle rendering is too slow
