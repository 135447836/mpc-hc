1.6.4 - not released yet
========================
+ MPCVideoDec: Add support for 4K for Intel HD Graphics 4000
+ AVI Splitter: Add a property page so that the support for non interleaved files
  can be turned on/off. Support for such files is now enabled by default.
  The old AVI Chunk Viewer dialog has been removed.
* Updated FFmpeg (git 6fa2532)
* Updated Little CMS to v2.4 rc2 (git 728139a)
* Updated SoundTouch to v1.7.0
* Updated MediaInfoLib to v0.7.60 r5048
* Updated ZenLib to v0.4.28 r403
* Updated VirtualDub to v1.10.3-test6
* Remove .dat extention from the icon library and the formats
  (you can still associate it in the "Others" formats)
* Re-enable the embedded resources viewer in the properties dialog and improve
  its "open in brower" function (when double clicking on a resource)
* Store the path to MPC-HC's executable in HKEY_CURRENT_USER for external use.
  External applications that depend on that path should get it from there rather
  than HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. The old key in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE will be removed in
  the next version
