1.6.3 - not released yet
=========================
+ New webpage
+ The DirectX runtime dlls are included in the distribution packages
  so it's no longer needed to install the DirectX runtime
+ MpegSplitter: support for DVD-Audio LPCM and MLP in .aob files
+ Use FFmpeg for AC3 decoding
* Replaced all custom and thirdparty image loading code in favor of Windows's CImage.
  This gives us support for other formats and we get rid of a couple of 3rd party libraries.
* Unrar is statically linked and so MPC-HC and VSFilter no longer need the unrar dll.
* Updated Unrar to v4.20
* Updated MediaInfoLib to v0.7.58
* Updated ZenLib to v0.4.27
* Updated FFmpeg (git 3b0ad04)
