Patches are always welcome. :)

MPC-HC:
1) Try to fix all /W3 warnings for Win32 in our code
2) Run /analyze and fix some of the errors; memory leaks, NULL pointer dereferencing, buffer overruns etc
3) Reorganize the player's Options
4) Remove support for unneeded/obsolete renderers
5) Update Bento4 library or see if we can use ffmpeg for this job
6) Replace the default old looking toolbar with a more modern one
7) Test MSVC 2012 more. We get hundreds of redefinitions for the DX headers which
   is normal since DX is moved into the SDK but we have to use the DX SDK for d3dx9, the MFC
   bloat workaround does not work as it is and unfortunately it is still needed. Another issue is
   that subtitles don't show with MSVC 2012 Release x64 builds
8) Add a .gitattributes file
9) Add FFmpeg and lcms2 as submodules

MPCIconLib:
1) Replace the file association icons with better looking ones

WebServer:
1) Enable caching
2) Update the images for player.html
3) player.html: with IE 9 things don't look the same as Firefox; the volume slider
   is out of bounds, the status and title text are not aligned to the left

FFmpeg:
1) Stop linking ffmpeg statically (still not sure about it yet)
2) Use ffmpeg for:
   * MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 decoding (this would remove the dependency on libmpeg2)
   * FLAC decoding (this would remove the dependency on libflac)
Alternatively, drop all internal decoders and filters and integrate LAVFilters, but keep DXVA1.

Installer:
1) Add file association tasks, see https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/mpc-hc/ticket/2207

VSFilter:
1) Use the defines from version.h for MPC_COPYRIGHT_STR in VSFilter
2) Define VSFilter's version numbers in a place accessible by its installer and VSFilter itself
3) Do we need the ISOLATION_AWARE_ENABLED define?
4) Backport a few useful patches from those VSFilter forks;  we need individual patches for that
   and we have to make sure that everything works right for mpc-hc itself
